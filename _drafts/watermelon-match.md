As an art response to the Global Day of Ceasefire for Palestine, on December 11th, 2023, I made a game called [Watermelon Match](https://bloomzeye.itch.io/watermelon-match), as a free browser game on itch.io.

I've talked and learned about Palestine in many of my creative mediums; clay, zines, crochet, sewing, digital art, writing, and more. 

However, I was stumped on how to talk about Palestine within my game development. 

Video games are used for entertainment, escapism, fun, and playfulness, but none of those adjectives were appropriate at this time.

Granted, that's not all of what games are, but I didn't want to be careless on how I was trying to tie my game development in with my response to current events.

Eventually, I realized that I could use art research to learn the significance of the designs I would create, which would give me the chance to find resources to learn more about Palestinian resistance, people, and culture.

### My design research process

My game and story ideas tend to grow either from a sketch, doodle, or a sentence. 

By using photo references of watermelons from Unsplash; a free stock photo website, and learning about the keffiyeh and the history behind the pattern, art research awards me the opportunity to learn the meaning behind the art I'm creating, and to understand the humanity from what others have created.

Collecting references for inspiration, using stock photo websites, thrifted books, libraries, videos, internet archives, talking and listening to others, and even my own photos, is all apart of my game design process.

When I take the time to slow down and build a foundation for my visuals and designs, my work feels more unique to my own creativity and imagination.

### My art process

Since this game concept was so simple, I pretty much went straight to Aseprite; a pixel art program, that I've been using since my start in game development.

I limited myself to about 2-5 art assets, and no animations. Since I only had a watermelon, the keffiyeh as a background pattern, and a simple heart for my particle effects, I was ready for programming within a few hours after I got started.

### Using a game engine

Since I don't enjoy tormenting myself and wanted to enjoy the game development process, I use GDevelop; a free, low-code (or no-code, as it’s also referred to as), open-source, visual scripting game engine. 

I've been making all of my solo games with this engine, and I've enjoyed the ease of getting projects started, the templates, the (admittedly bulky-ish) cascading stylesheet programming, community extensions and forum...and the fact that there’s the option to disable their “Ask A.I” feature within the engine.

*Note: When I made Watermelon Match back in 2023, GDevelop didn't have their A.I feature. That feature released around May, 2025.*

If you know me, then you know my general disdain for A.I generated art (simplifying all the terminologies, for now), so I won't get into it right now. But, I do kinda get into it in my video, "[All your Ai art excuses](https://youtu.be/WmWoWA1z6GM)".

### Ah...Programming 

Programming genuinely stresses me out, as it tends to demotivate me. However, when I finally get a code block working, VSCodium is back open before I even realize it, and I’m hooked back in…

My computer programming background consists of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As long as I'm motivated by my curiosity, I can gradually pick up and learn to understand most (frontend, at least) languages.

Even with a visual scripting engine, I still have to understand and follow the basic programming rules and workflows, in relation to the engine I’m using. 

I also managed to make this game touchscreen and mobile responsive! Even though I love my light purple, ergonomic keyboard (that I scored at a thrift store), I want to make my games accessible for various devices. It's probably *too* sensitive with touch screens, but I'm fine-tuning that workflow as I go along.

### Core gameplay mechanics

This is where creating small games prototypes ***saved*** my pixelated behind. 

My previous practice project was a simple drag and drop prototype, where the player matches up color boxes with its like-colored container. Essentially, I just changed the art assets and called it a day, using my own practice project as a template. 

Once I completed my main programing, I did whatever quick bug fixes I could, added a “win screen” that doubled as my “about me”, and published my game to my itch.io page.

It’s easier daydreamed than done, to take an idea and turn it into an actual game, but I’m always happy when I do.

### What I've learned

Making small game prototypes has helped me learn foundational mechanics, refine my workflow, familiarize myself with the game engine I’m using, see a project to completion, and grow my confidence as a game designer and developer. 

Whenever I create practice projects, it allows me to develop out of curiosity instead of a having a "deadline" mindset. I’m able to troubleshoot at an easier pace, take my time of exploring concepts and ideas, and just have fun.

When I take my time to learn a new mechanic, (try to) read the documentation, and ask for help when I need it (and ideally long before I’m desperate for it), I become more confident as a game developer.

### Closing thoughts

As I was learning more about injustices within my local community, and how what happens locally effects people globally, it didn't feel right to make indie games or pixel art. 

Eventually, I realized that I can choose the games and art I make and put out into the world. For this game, I just wanted to add something to my portfolio that says “I stand with Palestine”.

Thank you for reading my blog post, and double-thanks if you’ve shared it with anyone!
