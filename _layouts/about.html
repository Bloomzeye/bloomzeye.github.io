<p>Hi hi, I'm Bloomzeye! I'm a Black and Queer, Nonbinary (They/Them), indie game developer, pixel artist, and creative writer, who makes cute and colorful games!

<p>I've been making games ever since I drew that one really bad pixel art bee back in 2021, and turned it into my first published indie video game. After much practing and cleaning up the design, that is.

<h3 class="aboutSubHeader">about my blog</h3>

<p>My blog here blog is for documenting and experiemnting with my game development, design, art, and grow stronger in my creative and writing skills.
    
<p>Since I'm ace/demi and a lesbian, I want to start making games about the power of friendship...and lesbians! In due time...<i>allll</i> in due time.

<P>I'm not the best at web development, so this blog is going to be a little wonky as I continue to fix the code...and break something right after. Probably. But hey! Started is better than perfect.

<p>Some of my hobbies are thrifting and park dates with the homies, teaching my younger siblings game dev, crocheting or other fiber arts, and taking naps with my cat-son and cat-nephew.
